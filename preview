Doraemon is a beloved Japanese manga and anime character created by Fujiko F. Fujio, first appearing in 1969. He is a robotic cat sent back in time from the 22nd century to help a young boy named Nobita Nobi, who constantly finds himself in trouble due to his laziness and poor academic performance.

Doraemon is known for his blue body, round face, and the 4D pocket from which he pulls out futuristic gadgets to help Nobita. These gadgets—like the Anywhere Door, Time Machine, and Take-copter (bamboo-copter)—often solve one problem but lead to humorous chaos when misused.

The story focuses on friendship, morality, creativity, and often teaches life lessons in a fun and engaging way. Doraemon lives with Nobita and becomes a guiding figure in his life, encouraging him to do better while also getting caught up in funny adventures with Nobita’s friends—Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo.
